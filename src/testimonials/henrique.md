It was a blast having Emre as a teammate! I had the pleasure of working alongside him in different UX Research and Design projects for over a year at George Brown. I was continuously impressed by Emre's commitment to our projects, professionalism towards our clients, and immense design talent.

I've seen him perform a wide range of tasks (e.g. design and conduction of surveys and interviews, heuristic evaluations, wireframing and prototyping) with confidence and craft. He's the team member you can count on not only to get the job done but to be insightful and able to generate innovative solutions to complex problems.

In addition to the hugely positive experience as his colleague, I recall being always fascinated by the projects he showcased as a student â€” impressive future-thinking ideas accomplished with artistry.

I would gladly work with Emre in the future again. He's a substantial asset to have in any design team.
